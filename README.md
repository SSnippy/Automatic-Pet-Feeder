# Automatic-Pet-Feeder
This is an automatic pet feeder that uses blutetooth signal from a pre made app on the users phone to control the device.
This device has trwo components, food (servo based) and water based (air pump based).

The food component works using a servo, which spins to open and close a shutter allowing food to fall.
The water component needs to food grade to instead of using a water pump, an air pump pushes air form one pipe which allows water to flow up in another pipe.

All this comes together with an arduiono and bluetooth module.
